        Lezack is a page where Zack can post letters in the form of blogs or
        just normal blogs to show his boyfriend Leo. Blogs don't need to be
        something special, they can be something trivial that happened in the
        day or whatever, like a diary. These blogs are just for fun and because
        it's the only way for Zack to show his feelings for Leo without being
        embarrassed by his ugly handwriting or because he's really nervous to
        give him any real letters.
